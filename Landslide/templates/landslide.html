    <!--Landslide-->
    <section class="landslide">
        <h1>What is Landslide ?</h1>
        <p>A landslide is a type of natural disaster that occurs when a mass of rock, soil, or debris moves down a slope or incline due to various factors such as gravity, water, and erosion. Landslides can be triggered by a range of natural phenomena such as heavy rainfall, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, or even human activities such as deforestation, mining, and construction.
            The term "landslide" is used to describe a range of movements of earth materials including rockfalls, debris flows, mudslides, and other types of mass movements. The severity and impact of landslides can vary widely, depending on the size and speed of the landslide, the type of materials involved, and the location of the event. <br><br>
            Landslides can have significant impacts on people, property, and the environment. In urban areas, landslides can cause extensive damage to buildings and infrastructure, disrupt transportation systems, and result in loss of life. In rural areas, landslides can damage crops and farmland, alter the landscape, and affect water quality. <br><br>
            The study of landslides is an important area of research in geology, engineering, and environmental science, as it helps to understand the causes and mechanisms of landslides and develop strategies to mitigate their impact. Geologists and engineers use a range of techniques to study and predict landslides, including geologic mapping, monitoring of ground movement and deformation, and numerical modeling. <br><br>
            Prevention and mitigation measures for landslides include the use of retaining walls, drainage systems, and erosion control measures, as well as zoning and land-use planning to avoid areas at high risk for landslides. In some cases, early warning systems can be used to alert residents of potential landslides and provide them with time to evacuate. <br><br>
            In summary, landslides are a natural phenomenon that can have significant impacts on people and the environment. While they cannot be completely prevented, the study of landslides can help us better understand the causes and mechanisms of these events and develop strategies to mitigate their impact. <br>
            The study of landslides is an important area of geology, engineering, and environmental science, as it helps to understand the causes and mechanisms of landslides and develop strategies to mitigate their impact.

        <!--Sources of Waste-->
        <h1>Sources of Waste</h1>
        <p>Waste comes from four different sorts of sources: industrial, commercial, domestic, and agricultural.
        </p>
        <img src="images/SourcesofWaste2.png" alt="waste" width="800px">
        
        <h3>Industrial Waste</h3>
        <p>These are the byproducts of factories and businesses. The majority of companies pollute the environment by discharging their waste into rivers and the ocean.
            <br><b>Example:</b>  plastic, glass, etc.<br><br>
        </p>

        <h3>Domestic Waste</h3>
        <p>Domestic wastes are the many waste products generated by daily household tasks like cooking, cleaning, etc.
            <br><b>Example:</b> leaves, vegetable peels, excreta, etc.<br><br>
        </p>

        <h3>Agricultural Waste</h3>
        <p>Agriculture wastes include a variety of wastes created in the agricultural industry.
            <br><b>Example:</b>cattle waste, weed, husk, etc.<br><br>
        </p><br>

        <!--Types of Waste-->
        <h1>Types of Waste</h1>
        <p>Trash is frequently divided into two categories: biodegradable garbage and non-biodegradable waste. Here is an explanation of these two categories of waste:
        </p>
        <img src="images/waste2.png" alt="waste" width="800px">

        <h3>Biodegradable waste</h3>
        <p>These are the leftovers from our kitchen, which also contain yard garbage and other rubbish. Moist waste is another name for biodegradable trash. This can produce manure when 
            composted. The length of time it takes for biodegradable garbage to break down depends on the substance.
        </p>

        <h3>Non-biodegradable waste</h3>
        <p>These are the wastes, which also comprise used paper products, shattered glass, plastics, etc. Dry waste is the term for non-biodegradable waste. Dry wastes are recyclable and 
            reusable.
             Non-biodegradable wastes are significant polluters since they cannot break down on their own.
        </p><br><br><br>

        <!--Decomposition of Biodegradable Waste-->
        <h2>Decomposition of Biodegradable Waste</h2>
        <p>Several mechanisms can assist biodegradeable trash break down and turn into organic stuff.
        </p><br>

        <h3>Composting</h3>
        <p>By burying garbage in compost pits, waste may be digested and transformed into organic matter in this manner. The wastes are created by bacterial and fungal activity.
        </p><br>

        <h3>Vermicomposting</h3>
        <p>With the aid of red worms, organic debris is broken down into productive manure using this technique. Vermicompost is the name for this manure.
        </p><br>

        <h3>Chemical waste</h3>
        <p>Chemical wastes are wastes manufactured from dangerous chemicals, most of which are created in huge industries. Chemical wastes might be harmful or not. Hazardous chemical waste 
            might be solid, liquid, or gaseous and will exhibit poisonous, corrosive, ignitable, and reactive qualities.
